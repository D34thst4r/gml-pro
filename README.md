  Integration and this License:
 
  Note: you may integrate this pack into your GameMaker projects, including commercial ones.  
  
  To comply with this license you should credit
  "H. Elwood Gilliland III" in your game's credits, tagged with 
  "GML Pro Pack Contributor" or "Contributing Programmer" or simply "Programmer"
  
  If you make minor changes to the library, you do not need to release these under
  the ShareAlike clause unless they are solely an improvement to the overall Library.
  
  You do not need to ShareAlike your entire game application.
  
  The License covers:

   CRT1,CRT2, 
   Some shaders were based on shaders provided to the public domain by Themaister
   and also the author of mari0, someone named DOLLS, a person named cgwg, and a
   few other "anonymous copyright holders" -- and have various licenses.  GPL was
   offered as a license, but many of them are based on the work of other authors,
   and we're not sure who they were.  HQ4X for instance is an implementation of
   a technique discussed in a Siggraph paper, and some of the other shaders are
   merely knockoffs of either HQ4X or the Bloom shader.
